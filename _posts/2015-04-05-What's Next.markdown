######Almost 4 months ago, I was let go from SFX Entertainment.

What started as a seemingly normal day ended in a meeting with a totally unexpected outcome. Hearing the words, “it’s nothing personal, due to restructuring, we’re going to have to let you go” could not have been a more personal statement. Why me? What did I (or didn’t) I do that was so different than anyone else? I had heard rumors that salary cap had to be made free so Beatport could hire developers, but it didn’t cross my mind that it would start with me.  But just like that, I was escorted (yes, just like the movies) from the office and cast back into the real world.

I had spent almost two years working for ID&T and SFX, as an intern and a full-time employee and just like that it was all over. I sat on the corner of 53rd wondering what’s next, and not wanting to go home. After all I had been the first of my friends to be employed, landing what everyone described as a ‘dream job’.  I couldn’t bear to face my roommates and tell them I was unemployed. I just kept asking myself, “What’s next?”  

As the weeks passed, I started to become less self-conscious of being unemployed but I still wasn’t happy. No one was unsupportive, everyone knew I would find something else but they still kept asking the question, “What’s next”? I found that question to be incredibly fucking annoying and difficult to answer because I didn’t even know what I was doing for my next meal.  What was going to be my next job? Yeah, okay…

I still get sad from time to time, resentful, or sometimes even angry. At the end of the day I feel lucky. I am lucky that I got to work in such an exciting industry with a group of incredible people. It was a hell of a first job and I couldn’t be more thankful that I had the opportunity, even if it didn’t work out. I am still proud of what I accomplished and at this point, I wouldn’t have it any other way.

As for what’s next? I will be spending the next 10 weeks at Byte Academy, a financial programming bootcamp. But come June, I’m really excited to hear what I do next.
