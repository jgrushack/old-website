Jesse graduated Union College in June 2014 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Economics. After graduating, Jesse worked for SFX Entertainment until December 2014 and is currently a student at Byte Academy.

During his spare time at Union College, Jesse became involved in Electronic Music and started writing for [Dancing Astronaut](http://www.dancingastronaut.com/author/jgrushack/) in early 2012. With this new found passion, he went on to intern for [ID&T North America](http://www.id-t.com/company/) in Brooklyn, NY during the summer of 2013. After learning as much as he could about promotions, marketing and operations, Jesse still had to finish his senior year before he could begin to explore a career in music. After graduating, Jesse became a Product Manger at SFX Entertainment, working at the intersection between technology and live events. It was at SFX that he realized how important data was and decided become a web developer.

As of April 2015, Jesse is becoming a full-stack developer at Byte Academy focusing on Python, Django, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

When he is not locked in front of a computer, Jesse enjoys traveling, boating, music festivals and the outdoors.
